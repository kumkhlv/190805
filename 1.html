<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web)</a> is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.</p>
